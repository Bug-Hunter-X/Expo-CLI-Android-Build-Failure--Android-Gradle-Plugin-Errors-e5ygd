Solutions to this type of Expo build failure usually involve carefully reviewing the Gradle build files (especially `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle`) and addressing any inconsistencies or conflicting dependencies.

1. **Check Gradle Plugin Version:** Ensure the AGP version in `android/build.gradle` is compatible with other dependencies and Expo's requirements.  Consult Expo's documentation for the recommended version.  If there are multiple AGP versions listed, resolve the conflicts.
2. **Dependency Resolution:** Examine `android/app/build.gradle` and resolve any dependency conflicts. Tools like `./gradlew app:dependencies` can be helpful in visualizing dependencies and finding conflicts.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** A simple clean and rebuild using `./gradlew clean` and then attempting to build the project again can sometimes resolve temporary issues.
4. **Invalidate Caches/Restart:**  Invalidate the caches and restart Android Studio (if using it). This can help resolve caching issues that may interfere with the build process.
5. **Update Dependencies:** Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date. Check your `package.json` file and run `expo install` or `npm install` to update your project's dependencies.
6. **Examine Full Error Log:** Pay close attention to the full error log produced by the Expo CLI during the build failure. It will often provide the most specific clues about the root cause.
7. **Check Expo SDK version compatibility:** Ensure that your expo sdk version is compatible with the latest Android Gradle Plugin. Refer to Expo's documentation for version compatibility information. 

By systematically addressing these potential issues, you are more likely to successfully build your Android APK.

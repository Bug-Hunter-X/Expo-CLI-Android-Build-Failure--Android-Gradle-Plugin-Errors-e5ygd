This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with an error related to the Android Gradle Plugin, specifically a version conflict or an issue with the dependencies. This is not a common error message, but rather a collection of potential issues under the general umbrella of Android Gradle Plugin errors during the Expo build process. The exact error message varies widely based on the specific conflict or problem.

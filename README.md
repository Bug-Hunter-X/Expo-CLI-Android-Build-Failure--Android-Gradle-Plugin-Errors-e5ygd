# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: Android Gradle Plugin Errors

This repository demonstrates a rather uncommon set of errors encountered when building Android APKs using the Expo CLI.  The root cause is typically a conflict or problem with the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) and its dependencies. The exact error messages can vary greatly, making it challenging to pinpoint the issue.

The `bug.js` file (if applicable) contains a simplified representation of an Expo project exhibiting such a build failure. The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the resolution strategies.
